          <h3>Interview</h3>
          <p>After the initial interview, we have a much better understanding about your project. Now we generate a design brief to clarify between designer and 
client to make  sure we have the same goals in mind, and there are no misunderstandings. With the design brief, we also include a design estimate to 
break down the costs involved in the work described. Once the estimate is agreed upon, AvA Web Design will proceed with the project.</p>

          <h3>Research & Design</h3>
          <p>We now begin research on your company’s industry. In order to design a successful logo, advertisement, or any print or web campaign, we must have 
knowledge about your competition and your target audience. We search for inspiration, colors, concepts, and styles. We investigate the local competition 
and brainstorm brand new concepts to direct our clients towards success.</p>

          <p>We select only our strongest concepts to present to you for consideration. Our client chooses his/her favorite design concepts and ask us to make any 
edits and adjustments at this time. </p>
